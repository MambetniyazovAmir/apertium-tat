This folder is considered to be the "shared folder" for Tatar stuff, which is now involved in several pairs.

The people interested in Tatar as part of the apertium-tat-langX should work on it together, either directly
or through requesting needed features by mailing apertium-turkic and discussing things there (discussing things before 
making changes or at least letting others to know what you are doing is always highly recommended!).

If this approach seems to be a good plan and ideas about will it work that way at all
should be discussed first too :)
